# Day 1: Introduction to Programming Languages & Go (Golang)

## 1. What is a Programming Language?

- A programming language is a formal language for instructing computers to perform tasks.
- Examples: C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.
- Purpose: To communicate logic and instructions to computers in a way they understand.

### Why do we need programming languages?
- To solve problems using computers.
- Automate repetitive tasks.
- Build software, websites, mobile apps, games, etc.

## 2. Brief History of Programming Languages

- **Assembly:** Early, machine-level language, hard to read/write.
- **C:** Introduced structure and efficiency, but manual memory management.
- **C++:** Object-oriented, more powerful, but complex syntax.
- **Java:** Platform independence (runs anywhere), automatic memory management, but can be slower and verbose.
- **Python:** Simple syntax, great for rapid development, but slower and less suitable for system-level programming.

## 3. Drawbacks of Earlier Languages

- **Complexity:** Many languages (like C++ and Java) have complex syntax and steep learning curves.
- **Slow Compilation:** Languages like C++ are slower to compile, impacting developer productivity.
- **Concurrency Challenges:** Writing concurrent (multi-threaded) programs is difficult and error-prone in most languages.
- **Dependency Hell:** Managing external libraries and dependencies can be a hassle.
- **Deployment Difficulties:** Languages like Java and Python require virtual machines or interpreters, making deployment harder.
- **Performance vs. Simplicity:** Some languages (like Python) are easy but not fast; others (like C++) are fast but not easy.

## 4. Why Was Go (Golang) Created?

- **Developed at Google in 2007, released in 2009.**
- Creators: Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, Ken Thompson.
- **Goals:**
    - Simple and efficient syntax (easy to learn, easy to read).
    - Fast compilation.
    - Excellent support for concurrency (goroutines, channels).
    - Strongly typed and safe.
    - Garbage collection (automatic memory management).
    - Built-in tools for dependency management and testing.
    - Statically compiled binaries (easy deployment).
    - Designed for modern hardware and networked applications (cloud, servers, etc.).

## 5. Key Features of Go

- **Simplicity:** Minimalist syntax, easy to read and write.
- **Performance:** Compiled language, fast execution.
- **Concurrency:** Lightweight threads (goroutines), easy parallelism.
- **Fast Compilation:** Near-instant build times.
- **Standard Library:** Powerful built-in packages for networking, web servers, etc.
- **Cross-Platform:** Can build binaries for many operating systems easily.
- **Garbage Collection:** Automatic memory management.

## 6. Where is Go Used?

- Cloud infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes written in Go)
- Backend web services and APIs
- DevOps tools
- Networking tools
- CLI applications

## 7. Hello World in Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## 8. What Will We Learn Next?

- Setting up Go environment
- Writing and running basic Go programs
- Understanding Go syntax and structure
- Exploring variables, data types, and functions
